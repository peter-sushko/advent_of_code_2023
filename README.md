For solving advent of code puzzles
https://adventofcode.com/

This year's Advent of Code goal was to write clean, functional, and well-styled code. I prioritized the inclusion of docstrings and meaningful variable names, employed helper functions to simplify complex tasks, and, towards the end, added module docstrings to explain the solutions. Additionally, I followed professional practices by using Git for version control, working on separate branches for each solution, and having most of my code reviewed by a Google engineer during pull requests.

I got 32/50 stars and decided to stop here. I did it mainly because the winter break came to an end and my full-time responsibilities have resumed. The challenge was quite fun and I am looking forward to the next year's
